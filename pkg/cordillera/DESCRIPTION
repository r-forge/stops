Description: The OPTICS Cordillera measures the amount of clusteredness in a numeric data matrix within a distance-density based framework for a given minimum number of points comprising a cluster, as described in Rusch, Mair, Hornik (2017). Assessing and quantifying clusteredness: The OPTICS Cordillera. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics. \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1349664.} The package contains an implementation of the Cordillera in an R native version and a version that uses ELKI, and methods for printing, summarizing, and plotting the result. It also contains an interface to the reference implementation of OPTICS in ELKI.
