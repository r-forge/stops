Description: Structure optimized proximity scaling (STOPS) refers to a collection of methods that fit nonlinear distance transformations in multidimensional scaling (MDS) and trade-off the fit with structure considerations to find optimal parameters or optimal configurations. The package contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying different MDS models in a STOPS framework like Torgerson scaling, SMACOF, Sammon mapping, elastic scaling, symmetric SMACOF, spherical SMACOF, s stress, r stress, power mds, power elastic scaling, power sammon mapping, power stress, boxcox stress, local mds and isomap. All of these models can also solely be fit as MDS versions (i.e., no structure considerations). The package further contains functions for optimization (Adaptive LJ and for Bayesian optimization with treed Gaussian process with jump to linear models) and functions for various structuredness indices.
