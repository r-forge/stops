Description: Structure optimized proximity scaling (STOPS) refers to
    a collection of methods that fit nonlinear distance transformations
    in multidimensional scaling (MDS) and trade-off the fit with structure
    considerations to find optimal parameters. This includes cluster optimized
    proximity scaling (COPS). This package contains various functions, wrappers,
    methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying different MDS models
    in a STOPS framework like classical scaling, SMACOF, Sammon mapping, elastic
    scaling, symmetric SMACOF, spherical SMACOF, sstress, rstress, powermds, power
    elastic scaling, power sammon mapping, powerstress and COPS. All of these models
    can also be fit as MDS with power transformations. The package further
    contains functions for optimization (Adaptive LJ and for Bayesian optimization with treed Gaussian process with jump to linear models), functions for various structuredness indices (including the OPTICS Cordillera) and an interface to
    ELKI's OPTICS.
