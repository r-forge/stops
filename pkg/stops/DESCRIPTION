Description: "Structure optimized proximity scaling" (STOPS) refers
    to a collection of methods that fit nonlinear distance transformations
    in multidimensional scaling (MDS) and trade-off the fit with structure
    considerations to find optimal parameters. This includes "cluster optimized
    proximity scaling" (COPS). This package contains various functions, wrappers,
    methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying different MDS models
    in a STOPS or COPS framework like classical scaling, Sammon mapping, elastic
    scaling, symmetric SMACOF, spherical SMACOF, sstress, rstress, powermds, power
    elastic scaling, power sammon mapping and powerstress. All of these models
    can also be fit as metric MDS with power transformations. The package further
    contains metaheuristics for multi-objective optimization, functions for various
    structuredness indices (including the OPTICS cordillera) and an interface to
    ELKI's OPTICS.
