Description: Structure optimized proximity scaling (STOPS) refers to
    a collection of methods that fit nonlinear distance transformations
    in multidimensional scaling (MDS) and trade-off the fit with structure
    considerations to find optimal parameters or optimal configurations. This includes 
    the three variants of cluster optimized proximity scaling (COPS). The package contains 
    various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying different MDS models
    in a STOPS framework like Torgerson scaling, SMACOF, Sammon mapping, elastic
    scaling, symmetric SMACOF, spherical SMACOF, sstress, rstress, powermds, power
    elastic scaling, power sammon mapping, powerstress, COPS-0, COPS-C and P-COPS. All of these models
    can also be fit as MDS with power transformations. The package further contains functions for optimization 
    (Adaptive LJ and for Bayesian optimization with treed Gaussian process with jump to linear models) and function for various structuredness indices.
