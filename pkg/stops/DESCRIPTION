Description: A package for "structure optimized proximity scaling" (STOPS), a collection of methods that fit nonlinear distance transformations in multidimensional scaling (MDS) and trade-off the fit with structure considerations to find optimal parameters. This includes "cluster optimized proximity scaling" (COPS). The package contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying different MDS models in a STOPS or COPS framework like classical scaling, Sammon mapping, elastic scaling, symmetric SMACOF, spherical SMACOF, sstress, rstress, powermds, power elastic scaling, power sammon mapping and powerstress. All of these models can also be fit as metric MDS with power transformations. The package further contains metaheuristics for multi-objective optimization, functions for various structuredness indices (including the OPTICS cordillera) and an interface to ELKI's OPTICS.
