Version 0.0-9

- Added linearized (Shepard) and nonlinear shepard plots (NLShepard) for cops, smacofP, and cmdscale objects; made a new plot method for smacofP objects which is the class that powerStressMin returns;    

Version 0.0-8

- New author contributions in DESCRIPTION, added a plot method for cops objects

Version 0.0-7

- Added elastic scaling and sstress MDS models and fitted power versions of elastic scaling and sammon mapping; added simulated annealing optimization

Version 0.0-6

- Added procrustes and adjustment of configurations; improved the automatic handling of missing parameters in COPS

Version 0.0-5 

- Added 3D plots and devel snippets to be used in stops eventually

Version 0.0-4

- Added a STOPS high-level function to be filled with snippets later 

Version 0.0-3

- Added wrappers with S3 classes and methods to cmdscale, sammon. stops now enhances MASS and stats therefore.

Version 0.0-2 

- Added S3 classes and methods to cordillera, optics, powerStressMin and cops.

Version 0.0-1 

- Initial version. Successful prototypes.
