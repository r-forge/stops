Version 0.0-15

- Changed default stress measure in powerStressMin to sqrt(sum((d-delta)^2)/sum(delta^2)) (was non square rooted before). 

Version 0.0-15

- Added the three parameter version of power stress (also optimizing over weights). We can now fit smacof models, strain models, sammon models, rstress, sstress (all one parameter models optimization over kappa or lambda), powermds, powerelastic, powersammon (two-parameter models optimization over kappa and lambda) and powerstress (three-parameter model optimization over kappa and lambda and nu). Not possible (and perhaps never to be implemented) are the two-parameter models that optimize over (lambda, nu) or (kappa, nu). 

Version 0.0-14

- Fixed bug in plot.cops for argument transplot and objects of type smacofP. Wrote a test to check that. Removed a side effect for smacofB objects introduced by plot.cops. Added new slots to cop_smacofXX functions so one can plot.smacofP them  without the side effect. Needs to be tested further.

Version 0.0-13

- Recalculated the CA Climate data set. Added more tests. removed intercept in fitted model of transplots. 

Version 0.0-12

- Added more examples; added unit tests (rudimentary though, more and better tests will be added over time) 

Version 0.0-11

- Added CITATION info; added transformation plot (was NLShepard)

Version 0.0-10

- Added S3 object orientation to summary functions and made summary.stops and summary.smacofP and the according print functions

Version 0.0-9

- Added linearized (Shepard) and nonlinear shepard plots (NLShepard) for cops, smacofP, and cmdscale objects; made a new plot method for smacofP objects which is the class that powerStressMin returns;    

Version 0.0-8

- New author contributions in DESCRIPTION, added a plot method for cops objects

Version 0.0-7

- Added elastic scaling and sstress MDS models and fitted power versions of elastic scaling and sammon mapping; added simulated annealing optimization

Version 0.0-6

- Added procrustes and adjustment of configurations; improved the automatic handling of missing parameters in COPS

Version 0.0-5 

- Added 3D plots and devel snippets to be used in stops eventually

Version 0.0-4

- Added a STOPS high-level function to be filled with snippets later 

Version 0.0-3

- Added wrappers with S3 classes and methods to cmdscale, sammon. stops now enhances MASS and stats therefore.

Version 0.0-2 

- Added S3 classes and methods to cordillera, optics, powerStressMin and cops.

Version 0.0-1 

- Initial version. Successful prototypes.
