\arguments{
\item{dis}{numeric matrix or dist object of a matrix of proximities}

\item{theta}{the theta vector of powers; the first is kappa (for the fitted distances), the second lambda (for the observed proximities), the third nu (for the weights). If a scalar is given it is recycled.  Defaults to 1 1 1.}

\item{type}{MDS type.}

\item{weightmat}{(optional) a matrix of nonnegative weights}

\item{init}{(optional) initial configuration}

\item{ndim}{number of dimensions of the target space}

\item{itmaxi}{number of iterations}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to the fitting procedure}

\item{stressweight}{weight to be used for the fit measure; defaults to 1}

\item{structures}{a character vector listing the structure indices to use. They always are called "cfoo" with foo being the structure.}

\item{strucweight}{weight to be used for the structures; defaults to 1/number of structures}

\item{strucpars}{a list of parameters for the structuredness indices; each list element corresponds to one index in the order of the appearance in structures}

\item{verbose}{numeric value hat prints information on the fitting process; >2 is extremely verbose}

\item{stoptype}{which weighting to be used in the multi-objective optimization? Either 'additive' (default) or 'multiplicative'.}

\item{registry}{registry object with c-structuredness indices.}
}
