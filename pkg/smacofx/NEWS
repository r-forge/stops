Version 1.6-1

- Fixed a bug in the optimal scaling for the disparities. 

Version 1.5-1

- Added a weightmat and a type argument to bcmds and lmds. Not of consequence for the fit, but to streamline UI. Changed $weightmat slot in bcmds to diagonal matrix. 

Version 1.5-0

- Added Koller data snapshot.

Version 1.4-1

- Changed smpds (and related funcs) to weight zero is d(X)^kappa>tau, not d(X)>tau as before

Version 1.3-3

- Added argument normconf to bcmds and lmds so that the configuration get normed the same way as the power stresses (default is FALSE). Note that then the foo$confdist no longer matched dist(foo$conf). Added biplotmds for bcmds and lmds objects (which work better with the non-normalized configurations in these two). 

Version 1.3-2

- Fixed biplotmds to work with any objects that inherit from smacof (e.g. in cops).

Version 1.3-1

- Added a handler for the itmax in a call when using jackknife.smacofP oder bootmds.smacofP so that it is passed down accordingly. Necessary also for the corresponding methods in stops.  

Version 1.2-4

- Changed default nrep in multistart. 

Version 1.2-3

- Fixed jackmds and smacofxDeleteOne to also work with init. New multistart default and updates to docs.

Version 1.2-2

- Fixed returned calls for functions that internally call other functions.

Version 1.2-1

- Fixed jackknife to work with weightmat and also with bcmds and lmds. Updated docs.

Version 1.2-0

- Fixed jackknife for smacofP objects (jackmds).  

Version 1.1-0

- Added corpsepaint data. 

Version 1.0-1

- Fixed minor bugs in lmds and bcmds.

Version 1.0-0

- Fixed some docs and set numbering to start at 1.0-0. Fixed roxygen @docType change from here https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/1491. 

Version 0.6-6

- Fixed CRAN request: Exported biplotmds.smacofP. On CRAN now, initial CRAN release.

Version 0.6-5

- Fixed CRAN requests: changed \donttrun to \donttest, added on.exit() when there were changes to par, for examples that changed par we reconstruct the original par.  

Version 0.6-4

- Tested and submitted to CRAN. 

Version 0.6-3

- Updated examples for permtest to be <5s. Updated DESCRIPTION and docs. 

Version 0.6-2

- Changed init=NULL handling in the sparsified models. We now fit an rstress model instead of torgerson (more useful since we cut off based on fitted distances).

Version 0.6-1

- Added new clca and clda that wrap ProjectionBasedClustering::CCA as works horse.    

Version 0.6-0

- Renamed clca and pclca and clda and pclda functionalities to spmds (sparsified post mds) as our implementation is only inspired by CLCA. The used majorization is a quasi-majorization which means stress can increase in iterations or completely fail up until the point where we have a stable assignment of weight that are 0. The sparsity is not necessarily optimal and will likely be improved upon in the future.   

Version 0.5-0

- Improved clca and pclca objects. Added clda, pclda, som_pclda som_clda.

Version 0.4-3

- Some bug fixes, new docs and tests. Improved clca and pclca and som_clca som_pclca.

Version 0.4-0

- Made plot.cmdscalex with the same defaults as plot.smacofP

Version 0.3-2

- sammon can now also take data frames.

Version 0.3-1

- Updated cmdscale wrapper and the plot function for cmdscalex. Same for sammon. Factorized all into their own files.

Version 0.3-0

- Added function for self organizing map-style clca. 

Version 0.2-0

- Fixed compiling issues and methods and all. 

Version 0.0-1

- Forked the present functionality from the COPS and STOPS packages to this package.
