Version 0.6-0

- Tested and qualified more on clca, pclca etc. The used majorization is not 100% correct (I'll call this pseudo-majorization and it means stress can increase in iterations or completely fail) up until the point where we have a stable assignment of weight that are 0. Started work on fixing the majorization.

Version 0.3-2
