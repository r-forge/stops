Version 0.6-3

- Updated examples for permtest to be <5s. Updated DESCRIPTION and docs

Version 0.6-2

- Changed init=NULL handling in the sparsified models. We now fit an rstress model instead of torgerson (more useful since we cut off based on fitted distances).

Version 0.6-1

- Added new clca and clda that wrap ProjectionBasedClustering::CCA as works horse.    

Version 0.6-0

- Renamed clca and pclca and clda and pclda functionalities to spmds (sparsified post mds) as our implementation is only inspired by CLCA. The used majorization is a quasi-majorization which means stress can increase in iterations or completely fail up until the point where we have a stable assignment of weight that are 0. The sparsity is not necessarily optimal and will likely be improved upon in the future.   

Version 0.5-0

- Improved clca and pclca objects. Added clda, pclda, som_pclda som_clda.

Version 0.4-3

- Some bug fixes, new docs and tests. Improved clca and pclca and som_clca som_pclca.

Version 0.4-0

- Made plot.cmdscalex with the same defaults as plot.smacofP

Version 0.3-2

- sammon can now also take data frames.

Version 0.3-1

- Updated cmdscale wrapper and the plot function for cmdscalex. Same for sammon. Factorized all into their own files.

Version 0.3-0

- Added function for self organizing map-style clca. 

Version 0.2-0

- Fixed compiling issues and methods and all. 

Version 0.0-1

- Forked the present functionality from the COPS and STOPS packages to this package.
