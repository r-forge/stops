\title{Wrapper to \code{sammon} for S3 class}
\usage{
sammon(d, y = NULL, k = 2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{a distance structure such as that returned by 'dist' or a full symmetric matrix.  Data are assumed to be dissimilarities or relative distances, but must be positive except for self-distance.  This can contain missing values.}

\item{y}{An initial configuration. If NULL, 'cmdscale' is used to provide the classical solution.  (If there are missing values in 'd', an initial configuration must be provided.)  This must not have duplicates.}

\item{k}{The dimension of the configuration}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{sammon}, see \code{\link{sammon}}}
}
\value{
Object of class sammonx' inheriting from \code{\link{sammon}}. This wrapper only adds an extra slot to the list with the call, adds column labels to the $points and assigns S3 classes 'sammonx', 'sammon' and 'cmdscale'. It also adds a slot obsdiss with normalized dissimilarities.

Wrapper to \code{sammon} for S3 class
}
\details{
overloads MASS::sammon and adds class attributes for which there are methods. The functionality is duplicated in the stops package.

\examples{
dis<-as.matrix(smacof::kinshipdelta)
res<-sammon(dis)
