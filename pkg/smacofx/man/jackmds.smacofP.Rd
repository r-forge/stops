}
\description{
These methods perform an MDSJackknife and plot the corresponding solution.
}
\details{
In order to examine the stability solution of an MDS, a Jackknife on the configurations can be performed (see de Leeuw & Meulman, 1986) and plotted. The plot shows the jackknife configurations which are connected to their centroid. In addition, the original configuration (transformed through Procrustes) is plotted. The Jackknife function itself returns also a stability measure (as ratio of between and total variance), a measure for cross validity, and the dispersion around the original smacof solution.

\examples{
data <- na.omit(smacof::PVQ40[,1:5])
diss <- dist(t(data))   ## Euclidean distances
fit <- rStressMin(diss,"ratio",r=0.5,itmax=1000) ## 2D ratio MDS

res.jk <- jackmds(fit)
plot(res.jk, col.p = "black", col.l = "gray")
plot(res.jk, hclpar = list(c = 80, l = 40))
plot(res.jk, hclpar = list(c = 80, l = 40), plot.lines = FALSE)
