Description: Cluster optimized proximity scaling (COPS) refers to multidimensional scaling (MDS) methods that aim at pronouncing the clustered appearance of the configuration. They achieve this by transforming proximities/distances with power functions and augment the fitting criterion with a clusteredness index, the OPTICS Cordillera. There are two variants: One for finding the configuration directly for given parameters (COPS-C) for ratio, interval and non-metric MDS, and one for using the augmented fitting criterion to find optimal parameters (P-COPS). The package contains various functions, wrappers, methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying different MDS models in a COPS framework like ratio, interval and non-metric MDS for COPS-C and P-COPS with Torgerson scaling, SMACOF, Sammon mapping, elastic scaling, symmetric SMACOF, spherical SMACOF, s-stress, r-stress, power MDS, power elastic scaling, power Sammon mapping, power-stress and approximated power stress. All of these models can also solely be fit as MDS with power transformations. The package further contains a function for pattern search optimization (coined "Adaptive LJ Algorithm").
