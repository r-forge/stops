Version 0.1-1

- Added new scaling of configs in copstressMin for OC calculation. Using scale() distorted the optimal config. Now one can choose between sd (divided by max standard deviation), rmsq (divided by maximum root mean square), proc (Procrustes adjustement to initial fit) and std (which is the old way and now discouraged). Added switch in copstressMin for choosing stress-1 and explicitly normed stress, with stress-1 now the default. Changed default stressweight and cordweight.  

Version 0.1-0

- Removed old versions and development versions of functions. This is the package to be submitted with the paper. Incremented to 0.1-0. Removed optics functions.   

Version 0.0-3

- Renamed all coploss to copstress. Added a for loop version of powerstress (intended for optimization purposes eventually). Removed all optics code. Updated docs and descriptions. Added some S3 methods for class pcops that were only in stops.  

Version 0.0-2

- Changed defaults for coplossMin to stressweight=0.99, cordweight=0.01. Removed stops imports. Removed cordillera fucntions.
