Version 0.1-1

- Added new scaling of configs in copstressMin for OC calculation. Using scale() distorted the optimal config. Now one can choose between none, sd (divided by max standard deviation), rmsq (divided by maximum root mean square), proc (Procrustes adjustement to initial fit) and std (which is the old way and now discouraged). Added switch in copstressMin for choosing stress-1 and explicitly normed stress, with stress-1 now the default. Changed default stressweight and cordweight. Extended pcops to allow for the different scalings of X, changed default to the same as for cops-c. Now one can choose between TRUE or 1 which does centering/sd scaling the old way (each column differently now discouraged), 2 (scaling each column differently but no centering also not recommended when dealing with real distances), 3 (divided by max standard deviation), 4 (divided by maximum root mean square), FALSE or 0 for no scaling.
